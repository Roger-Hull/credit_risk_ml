Using Machine Learning to predict credit risk of loan applicants.

build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk using data you'd typically see from peer-to-peer lending services. Credit risk is an inherently imbalanced classification problem (the number of good loans is much larger than the number of at-risk loans). Employ different techniques for training and evaluating models with imbalanced classes. Use the imbalanced-learn and Scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using the two following techniques:

Resampling
Ensemble Learning
